Abstract:

For the structure from motion experiment, the techniques for estimating three dimensional structures from two-dimensional image sequences is explored. From a dataset of 101 480x512 grayscale images, the objective is to perform 3D reconstruction from the set of 2D frames of a hotel. This is achieved by implementing the factorization method, finding key features from the Harris corner detector, and using the MATLAB KLT point tracker also known as the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm.
